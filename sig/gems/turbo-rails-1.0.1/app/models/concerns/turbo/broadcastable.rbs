# Turbo streams can be broadcast directly from models that include this module (this is automatically done for Active Records).
# This makes it convenient to execute both synchronous and asynchronous updates, and render directly from callbacks in models
# or from controllers or jobs that act on those models. Here's an example:
#
#   class Clearance < ApplicationRecord
#     belongs_to :petitioner, class_name: "Contact"
#     belongs_to :examiner,   class_name: "User"
#
#     after_create_commit :broadcast_later
#
#     private
#       def broadcast_later
#         broadcast_prepend_later_to examiner.identity, :clearances
#       end
#   end
#
# This is an example from [HEY](https://hey.com), and the clearance is the model that drives
# [the screener](https://hey.com/features/the-screener/), which gives users the power to deny first-time senders (petitioners)
# access to their attention (as the examiner). When a new clearance is created upon receipt of an email from a first-time
# sender, that'll trigger the call to broadcast_later, which in turn invokes <tt>broadcast_prepend_later_to</tt>.
#
# That method enqueues a <tt>Turbo::Streams::ActionBroadcastJob</tt> for the prepend, which will render the partial for clearance
# (it knows which by calling Clearance#to_partial_path, which in this case returns <tt>clearances/_clearance.html.erb</tt>),
# send that to all users that have subscribed to updates (using <tt>turbo_stream_from(examiner.identity, :clearances)</tt> in a view)
# using the <tt>Turbo::StreamsChannel</tt> under the stream name derived from <tt>[ examiner.identity, :clearances ]</tt>,
# and finally prepend the result of that partial rendering to the target identified with the dom id "clearances"
# (which is derived by default from the plural model name of the model, but can be overwritten).
#
# You can also choose to render html instead of a partial inside of a broadcast
# you do this by passing the html: option to any broadcast method that accepts the **rendering argument
#
#   class Message < ApplicationRecord
#     belongs_to :user
#
#     after_create_commit :update_message_count
#
#     private
#       def update_message_count
#         broadcast_update_to(user, :messages, target: "message-count", html: "<p> #{user.messages.count} </p>")
#       end
#   end
#
# There are four basic actions you can broadcast: <tt>remove</tt>, <tt>replace</tt>, <tt>append</tt>, and
# <tt>prepend</tt>. As a rule, you should use the <tt>_later</tt> versions of everything except for remove when broadcasting
# within a real-time path, like a controller or model, since all those updates require a rendering step, which can slow down
# execution. You don't need to do this for remove, since only the dom id for the model is used.
#
# In addition to the four basic actions, you can also use <tt>broadcast_render</tt>,
# <tt>broadcast_render_to</tt> <tt>broadcast_render_later</tt>, and <tt>broadcast_render_later_to</tt>
# to render a turbo stream template with multiple actions.
module Turbo::Broadcastable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  module ClassMethods
    # Configures the model to broadcast creates, updates, and destroys to a stream name derived at runtime by the
    # <tt>stream</tt> symbol invocation. By default, the creates are appended to a dom id target name derived from
    # the model's plural name. The insertion can also be made to be a prepend by overwriting <tt>inserts_by</tt> and
    # the target dom id overwritten by passing <tt>target</tt>. Examples:
    #
    #   class Message < ApplicationRecord
    #     belongs_to :board
    #     broadcasts_to :board

    #
